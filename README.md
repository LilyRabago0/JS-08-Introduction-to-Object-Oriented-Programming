JS-08 Introduction to Object Oriented Programming


Exercise #1: A Person Object
Part 1 Javascript
Create a class called Person which accepts the name of a person as a string, and his/her/their age as a number.

The Person class should have a method called Describe which returns a string with the following syntax: "name, age years old".

For example, if Manny is 19 years old the function Describe of his object will return "Manny, 19 years old".

Part 2 HTML
Create an HTML page that has 2 input boxes: one for name and another for age. When someone enters a name and age, the page will show a list of "{Name}, {x} years old".
